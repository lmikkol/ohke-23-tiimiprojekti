## Opening application

To run the application user needs to select the "Taskeri.exe" file and open it. The application should start shortly.

### Creating an account

The view should look like this ->

User begins creating an user account by selecting "SignIn". The view should change to look like this ->

Now user needs to create an account and remember to include at least one uppercase letter, digit and special character. The app should tell user that "Account was created succesfully" and the view should change to the first view shortly afterwards. If account already exists, the application will send an error message.

### Logging in

User selects "Log In" and the view should change and look like this ->

Once user gets here the user continues by typing the account credentials, followed by pressing "Login" button and the view should change to the main view. The main view looks something like this ->

### Adding Tasks

While on the main view user can start creating tasks. Click the "Add Task" button and the task creation panel should pop up, where user can create task a title and description as portrayed below. ->

When user starts to create a task, the user must fill in both of the input fields, title and description. Both fields filled user can confirm creating the task by clicking "Add Task" button on the view they're currently on. This action adds the new task to the taskview form.

### Viewing Task Description

The tasks been created but user may wonder that how can one view the descriptions they've made for the tasks.
  There's open button at the bottom of the task form. When user clicks it the description should appear on the right side of the task view, like this ->

### Marking tasks as done and removing tasks

When user has finished the task they've assigned, they can mark the tasks as done implying the tasks been finished. This action is quite simply really and the task can be marked as done by clicking the black toggle box on the upper left corner of the task.
See picture below ->

The task automatically will be placed to the bottom, ordered by the date and time they've been created.
There's a possibility to reuse tasks as well if the user redoes the toggle action, therefore setting the task as not "done", indicating that the task is not finished. Not so fast, this how we recycle the task and so on, simple!

#### Removing the task

User could also remove the task if there's no need for reusage. Like marking the tasks as done, removing the task is simple. There's a tempting little red cross on the right side of the task, ready to be pushed and dump the task user used great effort creating... To avoid misunderstangings there's a picture implying where to find this particular cross. ->

When user feels that they're done with creating tasks and viewing what kind of achievements they're trying to pursue, they may want to really go out there and perhaps close the application? The solution is to click the "Log Out" button on the right side of the main program view. When user has been brought to the main menu once again, they need to find the big red button which says "QUIT". Clicking that the user has succesfully closed the application.
